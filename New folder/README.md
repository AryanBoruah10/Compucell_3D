This simulation folder is the most recent one for the cc3d model. This includes both the chemtaxis and the force gradient. 5 / 12 /25

Next goals:
1. Code stress besed mitosis
2. Chemotaxis conditions:
   1. Stromal cell next to ECM - No response
   2. Stromal cell next to muscle - respond
   3. Muscle cells respond to gradient not stroma
